# Specification Quality Checklist: FOCUS 1.4 Cost and Usage Columns

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Created**: 2026-09-28

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is a protocol specification repository, so field names, builder setters and the wire
  compatibility check are the user-facing surface and appear in the spec by design.
- The single [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker (FR-005, conformance profile approach) was resolved in
  the clarify session; see the Clarifications section of spec.md.
